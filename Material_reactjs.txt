Folder structure

node_module folder consist of all dependancy injectors.


Public folder
  |__ index.html

src folder
    |__ index.js(where we write js)
    |__ app.js (body of app)



> Understand component[9:58]

Most of our react code comprises of components

-> Search bar components
-> Sign-up component
->To-do list Component
  -->List item component
  -->Add new item (form)component


App.js
